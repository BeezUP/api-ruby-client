#Channel Catalogs

#This api allows you to manage your channel catalogs.   A channel catalog is an association between your store and a channel.  You will be able to: - map your catalog colums to channel columns. - map your catalog categories to the channel categories and define a cost of this category - configure the general and cost settings of the channel - enable or disable a channel - exclude products using filters for a channel - override product values for a channel - disable or reenable a product on a channel
