#The features exposed in this API are centered around managing Orders harvested from your configured marketplaces.\\ This includes: - fetching current information (as known by BeezUP) for a single or multiple Orders, - requesting Order harvest to synchronize your marketplaces and BeezUP accounts, - changing BeezUP data and requesting changes to your marketplaces (accepting, shipping, etc), - configuring automatic changes to marketplace based our newly fetched data, - creating and exporting reports for your Orders.
